## Project Description  

* Exploring the Impact of Visual Representation on Consumer's Choice
A ReactJS-based website developed for a conceptual Mental Health Clinic geared towards investigating the influence of visual representation on consumer decision-making. By leveraging ReactJS and Styled Components, the website provides an engaging and user-friendly front end that eases Doctor-Patient communications and integrates automation of brick-and-mortar processes.

*Key Features and Objectives:*

* **Exploring Consumer Behavior**: project delves into the relationship between visual representation and consumer choice, shedding light on how design elements impact perceptions in the context of topics with heavy social influence.
* **Visual Elements Analysis**: project conducts a comprehensive analysis of color schemes, imagery, and typography to understand how these elements affect consumer decision-making and attitudes.
* **Breaking Stigmas**: through design interventions, project aims to challenge stigmas surrounding mental health and create a more inclusive and supportive environment for visitors.

## Technology Stack

* **Front End**: built with ReactJS (for more information on utilized packages, check out the project manifest).
* **Styling**: Styled Components is used to provide modular, visually appealing styles and responsive design.
* **Backend Integration**: Firebase is employed for seamless integration, with its Authentication and NoSQL Database Management features.
* **Deployment and Hosting**: Firebase's hosting capabilities are leveraged to deploy the website, making it easily accessible and scalable.

## Getting Started

To view the website, head on over to <https://pax-psychiatric-care.web.app/> and take a look around. To run in development mode:

1. Install *node.js* >>> Latest LTS,
2. Install *git* & *Clone* this Repository,
3. Install Project Dependencies >>> *npm install*,
4. Start Development Server >>> *npm start*,
5. View website at <http://localhost:3000> where corresponding changes to code will be displayed;

## Usage Instructions

View Project folder & navigate to */src/components* to find all Front-End inputs.

Keep in mind that website uses Firebase Backend component setup (Authentication + Firestore). As such, sensitive configuration files have been omitted from this repo for security reasons.
